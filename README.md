<h2 align="center">My Tech Universe 🌌</h2>

<p align="center">When I'm not crafting stunning web experiences with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I'm in the C++ universe solving coding challenges and optimizing algorithms. My data structures and algorithms (DSA) skills are the secret sauce behind my robust problem-solving abilities. 💪</p>

<h2 align="center">Currently Crafting 🚧</h2>

<p align="center">🌦️ **Weather Zen:** My latest project is a weather app that brings real-time weather data to your fingertips. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it's designed to be as responsive as it is informative. Explore the code [here](https://github.com/Muhammad3490/Weather_Zen)! 📦</p>
